Resolution:
1600x900 or under, generally. For 16:9, I like 1280x720, and for 4:3, I like 1024x768. 1280x1024 is also an option if you like 5:4

Cursor:
In mouse properties, change the scheme to "none". This brings back the older-looking cursors

Wallpaper:
Choose wallpapers in your chosen resolution or slightly lower. Avoid 4K wallpapers or other very high-detail resolutions - they ruin the whole point of making windows 11 look so old
